# Challenge

Create a responsive card component that looks like the attached composite image (card.png). Use styled-components on a simple React view to accomplish that. Develop unit tests using your preferred test framework. Write a README.md with your assumptions, why did you pick that approach, what you could have done better if time was not a constraint. Push your code to Github and host a working demo of the solution using Github Pages.
